Description: This is a R package testing for trend in benefit-risk analysis with prioritized multiple outcomes. This package can be implemented for testing for trend in multiple settings. For example, in clinical trials benefit-risk analysis, we are interested to test whether there is a significant trend between the effect on the patients for different doses of a new drug compared with the control. This package enables us to test for the trend of the effect by directly combining multiple outcomes simultanuously.
